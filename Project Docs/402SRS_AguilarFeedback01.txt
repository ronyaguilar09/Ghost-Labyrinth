GhostLabyrinth Project SRS Evaluation
=====================================

Nice job on this, a great beginning.

Some suggestions.

When thinking of requirements, try to be even more specific about what 
you are specifying.  For example, requirement 5.2.1.5 specifies things
called "collectibles".  What will those be?  Another example, requirment
5.2.2.2 "limited radius of visibility" -- limited by what?  Can it be
set by the user as an option?  Or, requirements in section 5.3 which
specify "instantly" as a performance time -- how does one quantify that?

These are "philosophy of requirements" issues that you can apply in a
*general* way to nearly all the requirements in the document.  However,
in the essence of time remaining, I'm assigning full credit to this
deliverable, for both the initial and the final submissions.

You don't have to do anything further with this document if you don't
feel the need to do so.

Deliverable D-02: 15% out of 15% = 100% which is an A-plus
Deliverable D-05:  5% out of  5% = 100% which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!
